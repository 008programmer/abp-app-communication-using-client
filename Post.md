# 2- Adopting the new .slnx format to organize applications and services in a streamlined solution

## Introduction

This post is part of my <i>`Managing Communication and Restructring blazor UI in ABP Multi-App`</i>.
We are working with three primary applications:

- `Prabh.Stock` ‚Äì Manages stock-related functionality
- `Prabh.News` ‚Äì Handles market news and updates
- `Prabh.Finance` ‚Äì Aggregates financial data, integrating both stock and news insights

In this article, we‚Äôll simplify running one or more applications simultaneously by introducing a new .slnx solution file at the root level. We‚Äôll add all related projects into it using Visual Studio and organize them into solution folders for better maintainability.

These applications use `Blazor` for the UI layer and `PostgreSQL` as the database provider.

## Requirements

The following tools are needed to be able to run the solution.

- .NET 9.0 SDK
- Visual Studio 2022 or another compatible IDE
- PostgreSQL

Troubleshooting tip

- If you try to run more than one ABP application's UI at the same time through visual studio, you might encounter issues while running. A simple workaround is to open the second application in a different browser.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### Open & Run the Application

- Open the Stock Application solution in Visual Studio (or your favorite IDE).
- Run the `Prabh.Stock.DbMigrator` application to seed the initial data.
- Run the `Prabh.Stock.HttpApi.Host` application that starts the server side.
- Run the `Prabh.Stock.Blazor` application to start the UI.
- Repeat above steps for <strong>Prabh.News</strong> and <strong>Prabh.Finance</strong>
- Stop All Applications after checking they are working fine.

## Development

### üÜï Add a new Sln file by adding typing `dotnet new sln -n Prabh.Apps` in the root directory

- Add a empty solution name 'Prabh.Apps' in the root directory

- Ok Here is the Twist, dotnet has introduced a new compact & clean format slnx format. so lets migrate to it by typing `dotnet sln migrate`.

- Here is the format of new slnx

- Now open the visual studio using this new `Prabh.Apps.slnx`
- Then Right click and go to `Add` -> `New Solution Folder`

## üîå Run multiple apps

- To run everything together:

1.  Right-click on the solution > Set Startup Projects
2.  Choose Multiple startup projects
3.  Select:

    - `Prabh.Stock.HttpApi.Host`
    - `Prabh.News.HttpApi.Host`
    - `Prabh.Finance.HttpApi.Host`
    - `Prabh.Finance.Blazor`

4.  Once started, you‚Äôll have running instances of : `Prabh.Finance UI` and all `Finance, Stock, and News` backends

## Next

While we are now able to access the `Finance UI`, along with the `Finance, Stock, and News APIs`, from a single unified solution, there‚Äôs still room for improvement.

(coming soon)In the upcoming blog posts, we‚Äôll focus on decoupling these applications for better scalability and cleaner architecture. This will be done in two stages:

- Replacing dynamic proxies with static proxies

- Switching from project references to NuGet package references

Each step will be covered in a dedicated post to keep the process clear and focused.
